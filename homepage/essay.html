      <h2 style="text-align: center; color: red;">This is my NYC essay that I wrote in Junior year about 42nd Street, specifically about Times Square and the area surrounding it.</h2>

      <h3 style="text-align: left; color: black;"> 42nd Street
      </h3>

      <p>My NYC began 10 years ago when I first came to America in 2011. It was a completely different world compared to poland. Poland was filled with small towns and small cities. You could be driving down a road and see cows, sheep, chicken, regardless if you were 5 miles from Warsaw or 200 miles away. While Poland as a whole is very similar, NYC is completely different regardless of where you are. NYC is unlike any other city in the world not just because it is one of the biggest cities in the world but because of the amount of different people and ideas that were brought there. You can be in uptown Manhattan and you take the subway and in a couple of minutes you go from skyscrapers to little buildings and bodegas. You can be in Chinatown and experience some traditional dishes and you walk down the street and you’re in an area filled with hispanic foods and food carts. When I think of NYC I think of Manhattan and until I was in 7th grade I didn’t really go there much but it changed in the 7th grade. I would go every weekend there and experience it as I lived there part time. For me 42nd street, not time square, was my NYC and for me it felt as a center of NYC to me.

      <p>From 7th grade to freshman year of high school I lived partially at the Mima building on 42nd and 10th avenue on the 54th floor apartment 15, I was 2 blocks away from time square and 3 blocks away from the water. 42nd street seems to me as the perfect place to be in Manhattan. It is in the middle of everything going around and is the ideal place to stay at and travel in NYC. You’re in between midtown and soho and everywhere you want to go is very close. If you want to go to a park you can go to Bryant park where you can enjoy all of the little shops in the winter and Max Brener hot chocolate or go to the numerous other dog parks and playgrounds around. There is a ton of food around 42nd street such as $1 pizza, the one there called “99 cent fresh pizza” was my frist ever taste of NYC $1 pizza, japanese, mexican food, every single food you can think of is in the vicinity of you and tons of restaurants to go to.  You can take your bike and go toward the water to ride around toward the intrepid or brooklyn bridge. My favorite place was to go to Soho from the 42nd, because in less than 10 minutes you can go from big buildings and noises to small buildings and tons of life and new things to find. Even central park is less than 10 minutes away to go to and you can rent out a variety of stuff to have fun. For me 42nd was the perfect place in Manhattan, it wasn't too crowded but too empty, as long as you weren’t at time square which is a pain to be at and gets worse every year. If I had lived in Soho it would have been my favorite place in NYC but because I didn’t get to go there as much as 42nd it’s not because for me it was an activity not a place.  But 42nd and Soho go hand in hand to me because I remember taking the subway to Soho, getting food and being able to come back with it still hot.</p>

      <p>I dislike the tall buildings and crowds of people near 34th street or near the empire state building but surprisingly it’s not that at 42nd. You would expect that because of time square there would be a lot of people, but there’s not if you’re away from time square. It’s very peaceful and nice toward the water and for me I really enjoyed it because of that. You can go toward 5th avenue to go to all of the stores and rockefeller center or go toward the water to a park or to ride a bike. And the views from buildings were amazing being able to see the ocean and all of the other small buildings. To me 42nd is a weird place in Manhattan because it’s right in the middle of everything to do and right next to time square but if you’re away from time square you feel as if you’re in soho not midtown with tall buildings.</p>
